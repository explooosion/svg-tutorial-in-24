# SVG Tutorial in 24 Days

Welcome to the **SVG Tutorial in 24 Days** repository! This project is my personal journey to learn and master SVG (Scalable Vector Graphics) over the next 24 days by following the lessons provided on [svg-tutorial.com](https://svg-tutorial.com/).

## About This Repository

This repository serves as a record of my daily practice and learning experiences as I explore the world of SVG. It's primarily a place for me to document my progress, work through exercises, and solidify my understanding of the concepts. While this is a personal learning project, Iâ€™m happy to share my work publicly in case it might be helpful or inspiring to others who are also interested in learning SVG.

## Learning Plan

- **Day 1-7:** Introduction to SVG and Basic Shapes
- **Day 8-14:** Working with Paths and Text
- **Day 15-21:** Styling SVG with CSS and Understanding ViewBox
- **Day 22-24:** Advanced SVG Features and Animations

I'll be updating this repository daily with notes, examples, and reflections on what I've learned. This is a personal learning endeavor, so the content here might not be polished or perfect, but it reflects my genuine attempts to learn and grow.
